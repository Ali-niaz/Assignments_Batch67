I've been feeling anxious and low energy lately.

Oh, friend, I'm sorry to hear you've been feeling anxious and low on energy. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Remember, it's 
okay to not be okay, and acknowledging how you feel is a brave first step.

Anxiety can be like a storm inside us, and low energy can make it hard to find the sunshine again. Perhaps you could try some gentle self-care, like a warm bath or a quiet walk in nature, to soothe your mind and body. Sometimes, small acts of kindness towards ourselves can make a big difference.

Is there anything specific that you think might be contributing to these feelings?
